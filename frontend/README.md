# BCH - Bitcoin Cash Hackathon Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for the Bitcoin Cash hackathon.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Hackathon Tracks

### 🏗️ TECHNOLOGY TRACK
Innovative infrastructure, developer tooling, and middleware for building on Bitcoin Cash. This is for builders creating the scaffolding: contract compilers, minting SDKs, explorers, simulators, signing flows, APIs — anything that makes BCH and CashTokens easier to build with. Whether you're wrapping complexity, unlocking UTXO capabilities, or pioneering novel DeFi primitives, this track is about empowering others to build faster, better, and with less friction. If your project enables other builders, you're in Technology.

**What fits here?**
- Contract compilers
- Minting SDKs
- Explorers
- Simulators
- Signing flows
- APIs
- Developer tooling
- Middleware

### 🧠 CASHTOKEN SYSTEMS TRACK
On-chain protocols, coordination layers, and incentive systems built with CashTokens. This track is for token-powered logic: DAOs, DEXs, launchpads, NFT economies, staking contracts, auctions, redemption flows, governance layers, and financial instruments. You're not just building an app — you're building a system. A shell. A behavior engine. A protocol someone else might plug into. If your project designs economic or coordination logic, you're in Cashtoken Systems.

**What fits here?**
- DAOs
- DEXs
- Launchpads
- NFT economies
- Staking contracts
- Auctions
- Redemption flows
- Governance layers
- Financial instruments

### 🚀 APPLICATIONS TRACK
User-facing apps, tools, and interfaces that activate Bitcoin Cash in the real world. This is for builders shipping apps people can actually use — wallets, dashboards, plugins, bots, payment flows, onboarding tools, or bridges between crypto and real-world utility. It doesn't need to invent a new contract — but it should deliver something usable, frictionless, and real. If your project connects BCH to people, purpose, or problems — you're in Applications.

**What fits here?**
- Wallets
- Dashboards
- Plugins
- Bots
- Payment flows
- Onboarding tools
- Bridges between crypto and real-world utility
